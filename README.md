# Surge Breaker (1.9.9a alpha)
 *Surge Breaker - Genius Studios Project*
 
*This is the Unity Project for the Surge Breaker Genius Studios Project.*

## 1.9.9a Turrets: Final Pass

Note: This is a fully functional, playable demo version of the game.

### What's New?

- Changed: Final passing on the turrets. All turret models and adjustments to audio have been implemented

- Fixed: Play button now goes to level 1

- Noted: Death in Level 1 does not take you back to Level 1! Developer Jake can not fix this, due to the chance of conflicts arriving, as DO-Nutt is also working on this level. So keep this in mind before finalizing Level 1.
