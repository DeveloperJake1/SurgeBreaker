# Surge Breaker (1.6proto)
 *Surge Breaker - Genius Studios Project*
 
*This is the Unity Project for the Surge Breaker Genius Studios Project.*

## What's New

- The project has been signifigantly organized in order to create a more easily readable and modifiable environment. 

- Some of the files that you have been working on may be in new places. Make sure you look around for where they should (reasonably) be. None of your files were deleted, just moved to a different renamed folder.

- Created a **Level Template** scene, which has renamed and optimized ways in which the level objects are sorted. 
- Please use the **Level Template** when creating a new scene. To use the level template, simply press `Ctrl/Cmd + N`, and click `Level Template` on the screen that appears. 
- Created a **Enemy Template**, which can be used to easily create enemies for the `Path`, and for the `Player`.
- **Fixed** all broken fonts. Please *only* used the font "`Prototype Font`" when creating text with Text Mesh Pro (TMP), until the Genius Studios officially decides on which Primary and Secondary fonts will be used for Surge Breaker.
